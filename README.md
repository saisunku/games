# Tic Tac Toe Minimax Visualization

> A web app to visualize the minimax algorithm on a standard tic tac toe board

I used the Django framework for the back end. I used WebSockets, as implemented in [django-channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/), to maintain a persistent connection with the client. The tree is rendered using the d3.js framework.
